== Description ==

WP Finance Calculator is a drop in form for users to calculate indicative repayments. It can be implemented on a page or a post. It contains a real-time AJAX calculation option, which degrades gracefully on older browsers and uses a button to calculate repayments.

The plugin also contains an application form which sends a message to a specified email address.

The calculator features payment protection, and 12 to 60 months calculation.

The plugin can be used for car purchases, mortgage payments, real estate and big loans calculations.
