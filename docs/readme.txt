Finance Calculator with Application Form Plugin Readme
(docs/readme.txt)

Description
===========
WP Finance Calculator is a drop in form for users to calculate indicative repayments. It can be
implemented on a page or a post via a simple shortcode. It contains a real-time AJAX calculation
option, which degrades gracefully on older browsers and uses a button to calculate repayments.

The plugin also contains an application form which sends a message to a specified email address.

All features, such as application email, currency (rate and symbol) and finance rate, are editable
via the control panel in Settings | WPFC Options section.

The calculator features payment protection, and 12 to 60 months calculation.

The plugin can be used for car purchases, mortgage payments, real estate and big loans calculations.
